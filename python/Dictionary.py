# A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs with an immutable key and mutable value represented with the {} symbol
# Example of a dictionary
scores = {"Ayo": 98, "Abimbola": 95, "Zainab": 100}  # Where the name is the key and score represents the value
# Print(scores["Abimbola"])
# for i in scores.keys():  # For displaying only keys
#   print(i)
# for i in scores.values():  # For displaying only values
#   print(i)
# print(scores["Zainab"])     # For searching value in a dictionary
print(type(scores))  # To check for specific data structure type
